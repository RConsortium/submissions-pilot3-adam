# Overview

The objectives of the **R Consortium R Submission Pilot 3** Project are:  

1. Deliver a **publicly accessible** R-based Submission through the [eCTD portal](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/electronic-regulatory-submission-and-review/electronic-common-technical-document-ectd)
1. Expand on the work done in [Submission Pilot 1](https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-pilot1/), by now utilizing R to generate ADaM datasets.


**NOTE:** This is a FDA-industry collaboration through the non-profit organization [R Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/).


## What's on the Website?

This [website](https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-pilot3-adam/main/) encapsulates the hard-work of some intrepid statistical programmers from across the Pharma Industry
to demonstrate a R-based Submission to the FDA. 

The website is divide into 4 sections that will walk you through our efforts:

1. **Project Background/Setup** - Scope of work, what we used and how we used it.
1. **Deliverables** - What was sent to the FDA - Cover Letter, TLFs, Datasets, ADRG.
1. **Conferences** - Proceedings from different conferences on Pilot Submissions
1. **WG Minutes and Regulatory Feedback** - Provides a menu of links in two sections.
      - **Section 1**: Provides links to the monthly WG Meeting Minutes
      - **Section 2**: Provides a link to the Pilot3 Team Compilation of the Regulatory Review
             - Pilot3 Team *Interpretation(s)* of the Regulatory Feedback (FDA Review Continues)

   - *The R Consortium is delighted to share knowledge of the successful submission of an R-based test submission Pilot 3 package through the FDA eCTD gateway by the R Submissions Working Group. This groundbreaking achievement marks one of the early publicly available R-based FDA submission packages, including R scripts for generating analysis data model (ADaM) datasets and tables, listings, and figures (TLFs). The package adheres to eCTD specifications and serves as a valuable reference for future R-based regulatory submissions.*
